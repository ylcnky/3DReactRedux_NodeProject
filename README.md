## React Project for map integration in 3D City Models.
3D BIM model are on individual level. This project will present a top layer with a map. The map will include the CityGML model in which individual BIM files will be rendered.

## Purpose
BIM files are high detailed models which can be 100s of MBs. This project will aim to implement dynamic rendering of the building on demand by establishing the transition from mass 3D to detailed 3D.

### Phase
The project is in the initial phase development of a side project at Aalto BIM Research group.
